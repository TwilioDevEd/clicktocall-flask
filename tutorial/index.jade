    ## How It Works

    Let's go over the necessary steps to implement click-to-call in our application:

    ![Click-to-call Diagram](//s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/deved/clicktocall.png)

    1. A website visitor wants to connect to your organization.  She submits a web form with her
    phone number to receive a call connecting her to your sales or support team.

    1. Your web application receives the submission form. An HTTP request is initiated from your
    application to Twilio to initiate an outbound call.

    1. Twilio receives the request and initiates a call to the user's phone number.

    1. User receives the call.

    1. After the call connects, Twilio asks our application for [TwiML
    instructions](/docs/api/twiml). Our TwiML instructs Twilio to connect the user
    to our sales or support teams.

    ## What We Will Learn

    This How-To demonstrates how to initialize a call using the [Twilio REST
    API][rest] and how to create a TwiML call logic using the [Say][say] and [Dial][dial] verbs.

    Sounds like a plan? Let's get started!

.step(data-title="Our Flask Application", data-file='clicktocall/app.py')
  :markdown
    ## Our Flask Application

    On this example, we're using the [Flask framework](http://flask.pocoo.org) for Python.
    Flask is a popular, lightweight web framework that provides HTTP request routing,
    server-side HTML rendering, and an extensible stack to process incoming requests.

    To run this application locally, you can download it from the links above.
    After extracting the app to a local directory, make sure to run
    `pip install -r requirements.txt` in that directory to install all of the application's
    dependencies from [the Cheese Shop](https://pypi.python.org/pypi).

    This file, `app.py`, creates our Flask application and starts an HTTP server.
    Most of the server-side code for this example is located here. The HTML template
    containing the interface our users will use for click-to-call is in the `clicktocall/templates`
    directory.  Static assets such as images, stylesheets and JavaScript are located in
    `clicktocall/static`.

    We'll check that out in a moment, but first we need to configure our application with our
    Twilio account information.


.step(data-title='Application Configuration', data-file='clicktocall/local_settings.py', data-highlight='13-17')
  :markdown
    ## Application Configuration

    On this file, we store the account configuration we need to run the
    application. Rather than storing these configuration values in a source
    file, you may want to store them as system environment variables. On this
    Python code, we're reading in values from these variables. On systems such
    as OSX or Linux, you can quickly create new environment variables with
    `export YOUR_VARIABLE=somevalue`.

    Our app will need your Twilio account credentials and a phone number to
    use for outbound calls. Your account credentials can be [found on your
    dashboard](/user/account) - let's briefly explain what these variables are:

    * `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` : Your account SID - this is like your username for the Twilio API
    * `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` : Your auth token - this is like your password for the Twilio API
    * `TWILIO_NUMBER` : a Twilio number [from your account](/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming)

    Okay, now that our app is configured, let's move on to the code.
    We'll begin by showing how we render the home page for this application.

.step(data-title='Importing Dependencies', data-file='clicktocall/app.py', data-highlight='1-8')
  :markdown
    ## Importing Dependencies

    We'll kick off our project by importing some of our dependencies.  First, we'll
    get a number features from the Flask framework that we are going to use: the
    `Flask` class to create our application, `render_template` to deliver our HTML
    to the user, `request` to process the information in POSTs we receive from our
    users interacting with our form and Twilio, and `url_for` to construct the URL
    we need to share with Twilio for our TwiML.

    Next, we'll import a couple helpful bits from the Twilio python module: `TwiML`
    to help generate the instructions we give to Twilio for our calls and
    `TwilioRestClient` to initiate those calls with Twilio.

.step(data-title='Flask Boilerplate', data-file='app.py')
  :markdown
    ## Flask Boilerplate

    First, we'll create a file in our project root called `app.py` to seperate the
    boilerplate to run our Flask app from the logic of our Click to Call
    implementation.  This includes importing the `app` object we create in
    `clicktocall/app.py` and then running it if the script is executed.

    For Heroku users' convenience, if the `PORT` environment variable
    exists, we'll run the app on the PORT the environment specified.  If not, we'll
    run on port 5000 and turn on debug mode for as we work on our project.

.step(data-title="Rendering the Home Page", data-file='clicktocall/app.py', data-highlight="15-19")
  :markdown
    ## Rendering the Home Page

    This route is pretty simple - for requests to the root URL of our web app,
    we will render a [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/) template with
    the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to drive our click-to-call page.


.step(data-title='Form Post URL', data-file='clicktocall/app.py', data-highlight="22-44")
  :markdown
    ## Form POST Url

    This route will respond to an AJAX request from the UI for our click-to-call
    web page, which we'll examine in a moment. Here, we use an authenticated
    Twilio REST API client to make an outbound phone call to the phone number
    that was submitted by the user.

    For an outbound phone call, we need to specify a public URL for Twilio to
    request once the call has connected, so it knows what to do next. In a click
    to call application, these instructions could be as simple as "dial our
    sales number", or it could put a user into a full blown IVR system you've
    built.

    For this request, we assume that the domain that your app is running on, is
    stored in the "host" header (probably in production), but you could change
    this to be anything. When Twilio dials out to the user, it will use the
    TwiML generated by the `/outbound` route, which we'll examine next.

.step(data-title='Controller - TwiML Instructions', data-file='clicktocall/app.py', data-highlight='47-61')
  :markdown
    ## Controller - TwiML Instructions

    Before Twilio connects a call, it needs to know what to do once the call
    is made. Twilio will request these instructions from your web app as an XML
    document, using tags that we call [TwiML](/docs/api/twiml) that tells it what
    to do.

    In this route, we are going to use the Twilio Python module to generate an
    XML document that looks like this, using the Twiml `Say` and `Dial` tags:

        <Response>
          <Say voice="alice">
            Thanks for calling [...]
          </Say>
          <!-- in a real app, you would dial your sales team or whomever -->
          <!--
          <Dial>+16515551111</Dial>
          -->
        </Response>

    That's most of the interesting bits on the back end - let's move to the
    front end code to see how we're collecting the phone number from the user.

.step(data-title='UI: Styles', data-file='clicktocall/templates/index.html', data-highlight="2-12")
  :markdown
    ## UI: Styles

    Here on our home page, we generate an HTML page that we present to a user so
    they can click a button to get connected with us. To make the page a little
    more friendly, we include styles from [Twitter
    Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). We also include styles for a
    third-party jQuery plugin that make it easier to collect and validate
    international phone numbers.

.step(data-title="UI: Form", data-file='clicktocall/templates/index.html', data-highlight="27-43")
  :markdown
    ## UI: Form Structure

    In the body of our HTML template, we generate a form with a single text
    field for the user to enter their phone number. We assign unique IDs to both
    the form and the phone number text field, since we will need them in the
    JavaScript we write to submit this form. Let's take a look at that code
    next.


.step(data-title='UI: Smart Phone Number Field', data-file='clicktocall/static/js/app.js', data-highlight="4-8")
  :markdown
    ## UI: Smart Phone Number Field

    Our click to call page makes use of a [jQuery
    plugin](https://github.com/Bluefieldscom/intl-tel-input) to present a nice
    looking, auto-validating phone number input.  Here, we tell the plugin to
    decorate a text field with a given ID and tell it to validate numbers as the
    user types.

.step(data-title='UI: Submitting the Form', data-file='clicktocall/static/js/app.js', data-highlight='10-32')
  :markdown
    ## UI: Submitting the Form

    This chunk of code overrides the default form submission behavior of the
    HTML page to asynchronously submit the form via Ajax.

    When the form is submitted, we listen for that event in JavaScript, and
    cancel the default behavior in the DOM (which is to submit the form and
    initiate a page turn).  Next, we create an Ajax request to our back end,
    passing along the phone number which was entered by the user.

    When the Ajax request completes, the server sends a brief JSON response with
    either a success message or an error.  In the success case, we display an
    alert indicating the call was connected successfully.

  :markdown
    ## Where to next?

    That's it! We've just implemented click to call that allows your customers to connect with a
    support agent.
